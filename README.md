# Large Number Arithmetic Calculator

## Overview
This program is a console-based calculator that calculates basic arithmetic operations on large integers (Known as Big Numbers).
The operations supported include addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 
The program reads input numbers as arrays of digits and does the calculations accordingly.

## Features (Till now)
- Addition of large integers
- Subtraction of large integers
- Multiplication of large integers

## Usage

### Input
- The program will ask you to enter two large integers, one at a time.
- After entering each number, press `Enter`.

### Operations
Once the input numbers are given, the program will ask you to select an operation:
- `1` - Addition
- `2` - Subtraction
- `3` - Multiplication
- `4` - Division (currently not implemented)

### Output
The result of the chosen operation will be displayed on the console.

## Example
Enter your first number: ***n1*** 
Enter your second number: ***n2***

Select the operation: 1 - Addition 2 - Subtraction 3 - Multiplication 4 - Division

***1*** 
Result: 19134
